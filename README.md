#Beeline
The Beeline Application consists of two parts: A web application and an Android application. The web application allows you to create a user login and create/name lists of ingredients. The Android application is used when the user is at the store and ready to shop. It will tell the user where each of the items on the list is at in the store.

#How To
The web application URL is beeline-db.herokuapp.com

The Android application code is in this directory, and needs to be built. The running device must have a WiFi connection.

#About
The web application uses Ruby on Rails and a PostGres database to store the data. The Android application was created in Android Studio using Java.
